# react-see-through

## Draw attention to the important parts of your website
### Example
![Example](example.png)
**\* react-see-through is used here to create the black mask above everything except the tutorial - [source](https://calsynk.com)**

## Use cases
* Slack, Discord, and many other popular services use this type of effect for tutorials
  * This lets them direct users' attention to particular elements being introduced.

### [GitHub](https://github.com/andrew4699/react-see-through)

## Future Plans
* See-through multiple elements at once
* Allow interacting (click, hover, etc...) with the unmasked area
* Do it without a <div> wrapper
* Fade-out animation
* Better documentation styling
